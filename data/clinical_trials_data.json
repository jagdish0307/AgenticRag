                    "briefSummary": "The primary objective of the study is to assess whether chronic treatment with olanzapine over a five-month period produces a significant increase in abnormalities in glucose levels. The main secondary objective is to evaluate whether the increase in glucose levels and rate of glucose abnormalities differs between Olanzapine and Risperidone during this treatment period. Additional secondary objectives of the study are to investigate similar questions with respect to glycohemoglobin, triglycerides and other measures of glucose and lipid metabolism.\n\nWe hypothesize that Olanzapine will not be inferior to Risperidone in extent of increase in the primary outcome measure of serum glucose, and secondary measures of glycohemoglobin, insulin and lipids.",
                    "detailedDescription": "In the on-going study in progress we use an extensive battery of assessments to investigate a)fasting levels of glucose and lipids at baseline and monthly during 5 months of treatment, b) glucose tolerance tests to investigate glucose and insulin abnormalities after a glucose load at baseline and during study treatment, and c)the effects of treatment with olanzapine and risperidone of post prandial glucose metabolism after a fatty meal (as detailed in the body of the proposal). Recent studies have shown that increased postprandial lipidemia is an important feature of many patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. In addition to the biochemical measures, we will also assess clinical effects (PANSS and CGI ratings) and other side-effects (weight gain, appetite, somnolence, and EPS and TD). The specific plan calls for inpatients in a tertiary care hospital to be randomly assigned to olanzapine or risperidone, using a stratified random assignment procedure, and treated for five months with either olanzapine or risperidone. We estimate that we will have to enroll a sample of approximately 50-55 patients to obtain 46 acceptable complete cases(as specified in proposal below). On the basis of preliminary results from our prior and ongoing studies we predict no significant increase in glucose abnormalities from baseline during chronic treatment with olanzapine and no significant differences in development of glucose abnormalities in patients in patient treated with olanzapine and risperidone.\n\nAdditional measures being investigated include: comparison of olanzapine and risperidone in glucose and lipid responses to a fatty meal, ghrelin changes in response to a fatty mean, and CRP and IL-6, and thyroid and prolactin response to five months of treatment with the two drugs."

It is suggested as a new paradigm in nutritional education.\n\nThis project will cover the \"HOMECOOKING: cooking and eating at home\", as an innovative strategy, aiming to improve the quality of the diet of people with type II diabetes mellitus through an intervention based on cooking workshops. At these sessions, participants will learn easy cooking techniques and tools, in order to acquire culinary competences and to be empowered to prepare healthy dishes.\n\nThe effect of this intervention programme on the health of the participants will be evaluated through the measurement of biochemical parameters related to the disease (glycosylated haemoglobin, insulin, glucose, among others). In addition, specific compounds known as advanced glycation end products (AGEs) will be measured. The formation of these compounds is associated with the type of food consumed and the culinary techniques that are applied.",
                    "detailedDescription": "One of the main factors influencing health is nutrition. Therefore, lifestyle and more specifically healthy eating habits, are key elements for the promotion of healthy lifestyle in society. Eating habits are defined as the more or less conscious, collective and repetitive behaviour that leads people to select, consume and use a certain foods or diet, in response to social and/or cultural influences. The acquisition of eating habits occurs since childhood. For this reason, an education in food and gastronomy is necessary to promote healthy eating habits in society. Education programmes so far have focused on nutrition education, i.e. on transferring theoretical knowledge about nutrition. However, currently, it is known that traditional knowledge about nutrition is not sufficient and it is necessary to go deeper into the factors that determine what people eat, and how people eat.\n\nThe studies related to the sensory perception of food and the relationship that this perception has with the choice of food, seek to decipher the keys that make different individuals to have certain eating habits based on: personal tastes, the influence of culture, the emotions that make them feel, learning, and so on. Nutritional recommendations will always be simpler to follow when, implicit in them, the tastes and food choices of each individual are found.\n\nFrom a holistic perspective, individuals should be considered as a human being within a social, cultural and technological environment. In this sense, gastronomy is defined as \"the reasoned knowledge of what people eat and how people eat. It is an interdisciplinary area of knowledge that studies and generates physical-chemical, cultural and socioeconomic processes where human beings cultivate, process, distribute and consume good foods and beverages that affect their physical, mental and social well-being\". Gastronomy is a vehicle capable of creating social trends and the convergence of this discipline together with nutritional education can be a more effective tool to disseminate messages about what is considered a healthy diet, how to eat a healthy diet, as well as to transfer cooking skills that allow the population to acquire and sustain these eating habits at home.\n\nBriefly, gastronomy plays a fundamental role in covering the nutritional needs of the general population, and at the same time, it satisfies their expectations of flavour. Therefore, gastronomy is considered a decisive channel to favour education of taste, a better nutrition and, in general, for health promotion.\n\nThe effect of nutrition on health is not homogeneous in the population. On the one hand, factors such as the type of food and the culinary techniques used have an influence. On the other hand, individual characteristics such as lifestyle, genetic background and wellbeing must be taken into account. In this context, Personalized and Precision Gastronomy based on individuals' eating habits, genetic profile, intestinal microbiota profile, metabolome, epigenome, tastes and preferences, and so on, in order to develop strategies that favour a healthy and tailor-made diets for each individual.\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most prevalent metabolic diseases worldwide. In the Basque Country, it is estimated that the disease affects 10% of the population. People with diabetes have a high risk of suffering complications related to this illness. In addition, people with T2DM are more prone to develop other diseases such as cardiovascular diseases as well as premature mortality. For this reason, it is necessary to prevent the disease and to try to reduce the risk of developing complications in people who have already been diagnosed with T2DM.\n\nThe current increase in DMT2 is associated with an increase in obesity. This multifactorial disease, in turn, has been related to unhealthy lifestyles. Moreover, apart from physical activity, following a healthy diet is a determining factor. Although there is increasing information on nutrition, the desired effect on the prevention of this disease is not being achieved. This may in part be due to a lack of skills to continue a healthy diet.\n\nAttention should also being paid to individual factors that may influence in specific nutritional needs of T2DM. In this sense, personalised gastronomy can facilitate the empowerment of people with diabetes providing them with culinary techniques and skills that allow patients to follow a healthy diet adapted to the conditions of this disease and to personal needs and preferences.\n\nIn this context, the HOME COOKING project seeks to carry out a one-month culinary intervention programme with people diagnosed with T2DM, in order to analyse the health effects that the programme can produce, comparing it with the results obtained with a traditional intervention solely based on the training of theoretical recommendations about nutrition.\n\nIn conclusion, the main hypothesis of this project lies in the fact that one of the barriers for the population to acquire and maintain healthy eating habits is related, in part, to the fact that they do not have enough culinary skills (food preparation) and do not have sufficient knowledge about nutrition (knowledge about the product). Thus, bearing in mind that several studies have demonstrated the relationship between the trust (empowerment) that provides to have food preparation skills (culinary skills), and knowledge about the quality of the diet in terms of health, the present project suggests that beneficial effects on health can be obtained when nutritionists and public health professionals promote culinary intervention programmes aimed at providing theoretical and practical knowledge.\n\nTherefore, this project is novel since it proposes a paradigm shift promoting the incorporation of culinary training as a complement to nutritional education. Likewise, the project is based on the Mediterranean diet, a diet pattern whose health benefits have been scientifically endorsed. The study is a reference project in this field and its results will be of great relevance to public health."

Both groups will enter the study after the graduation from 8-hour diabetes education course taught at VGH, St. Paul's, or Richmond Hospital. The first group will receive on-going support from their peers who have diabetes and are trained specifically to help other patients with diabetes. The second group will receive the usual care.",
                    "detailedDescription": "This two-phase study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing usual care to a 12-month peer-led DSMS intervention designed to improve long-term diabetes-related health outcomes.\n\nIn Phase 1, the research team will implement a 30-hour peer leader training (PLT) program recruiting adults with type 2 diabetes and equipping them with the diabetes knowledge, facilitation strategies, and communication skills to deliver a DSMS intervention. In Phase 2, the researchers will conduct the peer support intervention, referred to as the Peer-Led, Empowerment-based Approach to Self-management Efforts in Diabetes (PLEASED). Patients randomized to the PLEASED arm will be paired with a peer leader and receive 12 weekly contacts (face-to-face and telephone support) from their peer leader (PL) in the first 3 months followed by 18 bi-weekly telephone support contacts over the last 9 months.\n\nThe goal of the PLEASED intervention is to help patients improve glycemic control and diabetes specific QOL and sustain these health benefits over the long-term. To achieve this goal, PLs will address 3 key functions of peer support that include assisting patients in the daily management of their diabetes, providing social and emotional support, and linking patients to clinical care resources.\n\nParticipants' inclusion criteria are: to (1) have type 2 diabetes, (2) be 21 years, (3) speak English or Vietnamese or any languages that their peer leaders speak, (4) be willing to be matched with a peer leader, and (5) have a personal land line telephone or mobile phone.\n\nPeer leaders' inclusion criteria are: (1) have diabetes, (2) be 21 years, (3) speak English, (4) have transportation to attend training, (5) be willing to commit to a 30-hour training program, and (6) have a land line telephone or mobile phone (7) have a self-reported HbA1c of 8% or less."

                    "briefSummary": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is becoming a leading global epidemic. DM affects several systems in the body. Most of the complications encountered in DM are attributed to uncontrolled hyperglycemia or poor glycemic control. Hyperglycemic stress tends to damage the inner lining of the small blood vessels (endothelium). Normally, the endothelium releases a chemical substance called nitric oxide (NO) which relaxes the blood vessels and also prevents blockade of these vessels. Therefore damage to the endothelium (endothelial dysfunction) results in diminished levels of NO which ultimately leads to occlusion of these small blood vessels (microvascular occlusion). Microvascular occlusion of vessels supplying the eyes, kidneys and nerves leads to serious complications like diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy.\n\nOf late, the skeletal system has emerged as another vulnerable target of diabetic microvascular disease. Patients with DM have an increased risk of developing fractures. Certain predisposing factors like diabetic neuropathy and visual disturbances (retinopathy and cataract) increases the likelihood of fractures in DM. More recently, evolving research has demonstrated NO's prospective role in bone preservation. Earlier studies have also validated the use of nitrates (donor of NO) in improving bone strength and reducing the risk of fractures.\n\nSo far no study has investigated the effect of nitrates on endothelial function and bone microarchitecture in patients with diabetes. The investigators therefore propose to investigate the influence of nitrates on endothelial dysfunction and bone integrity in patients with type 2 diabetes. 40 patients with type 2 DM will be recruited into the study; 20 patients will receive 20 mg of oral isosorbide mononitrate daily and the other 20 will not receive the study drug. The investigators hope to demonstrate an improvement in endothelial function (by measuring skin blood flow) and bone integrity (by measuring markers of bone formation and bone resorption and bone mineral density - BMD) following 6 months of nitrate therapy.",
                    "detailedDescription": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic debilitating disease that affects almost all the systems in the body with accompanying diabetic complications (neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy) adding to the global burden of DM. These diabetic complications arise as a manifestation of hyperglycaemic damage induced at the cellular level particularly the endothelial cells (EC). Exposure to hyperglycaemic stress causes endothelial dysfunction, which is the major perpetrator of microvascular disease. Disruption of endothelial function also marks the advent of the subsequent development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) that includes atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). Microvascular disease occurs as a result of deficiency of a potent endothelial vasodilator, nitric oxide (NO). NO plays a fundamental role in vascular regulation which is mediated through vasodilation. Other favourable characteristics of NO include antiplatelet activity and prevention of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. Unsurprisingly, diminished NO levels in DM will eventually lead to occlusion of the microvasculature in the retina, glomerulus and peripheral nerve (vasa nervorum).\n\nOf late, the skeletal system has also emerged as another vulnerable target of diabetic microvascular disease. Certain predisposing factors like diabetic neuropathy (DN), visual disturbances (retinopathy and cataract), gait abnormalities and hypoglycemia increase the likelihood of fractures in DM. Among these factors DN contributes to a major extent in the development of fractures especially fractures of the lower extremities.\n\nCurrent antiresorptive therapies include estrogen/ HRT (Hormone replacement therapy), bisphosphonates (BPP), selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) and denosumab (DMB). These agents mainly retard bone resorption in the trabecular bone, with minimal effects on cortical bone and are associated with only a 20-30% reduction in the risk of non-vertebral fractures. Moreover, they decrease bone formation and are not devoid of adverse effects. Some of these agents are also expensive and at times unavailable in some countries. All these limitations challenge the discovery of an ideal agent that can prevent bone resorption, increase bone formation and also reduce the risk of non-vertebral fractures.\n\nLately the therapeutic role of organic nitrates (source of NO) in bone metabolism has led to a breakthrough in this field of research. Nitrates are commonly used in the treatment of angina. Since nitrates are widely available, inexpensive and associated with limited side effects, it would be practical to exploit these characteristic features in the treatment of bone disease and endothelial dysfunction in DM.\n\nAIMS\n\nThis pilot study aims to investigate the effect of Isosorbide mononitrate in patients with type 2 DM with respect to:\n\n* Its influence on bone remodelling by assessing the levels of bone markers and its ability to improve BMD.\n* Its role in modulating endothelial dysfunction.\n\nHYPOTHESIS\n\nIn this randomised pilot study, patients with type 2 DM who receive 20 mg of Isosorbide mononitrate will show:\n\n* An improvement in bone formation as measured by serum procollagen type 1 amino terminal propeptide (P1NP)\n* Suppression of bone resorption as assessed by measurement of serum C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type-I collagen (CTX)\n* Improvement in calcaneal BMD\n* Improvement in endothelial mediated vasodilation.\n\nPATIENTS 40 female/ male subjects with type 2 DM will be considered eligible for the study. They will be recruited from the Tameside Diabetes Centre and appropriate GP practices and a written consent will be obtained from them prior to participation in the study.\n\nSince there is no placebo in this study, the research fellow and research nurse will be blinded to the treatment the patient is receiving. As it is known that the duration of diabetes can affect microvascular circulation and possibly bone metabolism, the two groups will be matched for the following variables: age, gender, duration of diabetes and severity of neuropathy.\n\nDiabetes self-education and management along with dietary advice will be provided to all the participants in the study.\n\nRANDOMISATION\n\nWith the help of a computer-generated program the study participants will be randomised into 2 groups:\n\n* Group 1: 20 subjects will receive 20 mg/day of isosorbide mononitrate orally\n* Group 2: 20 subjects will receive standard care\n\nMEASUREMENTS Biochemical parameters at baseline and 6 months later\n\n* Serum procollagen type 1 amino terminal propeptide (P1NP), a marker of bone formation which indicates osteoblastic activity.\n* Serum C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type-I collagen (CTX), a marker of bone resorption Clinical parameters at baseline\n* Laser Doppler imaging\n* Calcaneal BMD (Sahara clinical bone sonometer; Hologic, Waltham, MA) Blood samples will be obtained from the antecubital vein following an overnight fast and after resting for 15 minutes in the supine position.\n\nAssessment of the microcirculation with Laser Doppler Iontophoresis at baseline and 6 months A standard measurement of microcirculation is laser Doppler iontophoresis, which is used by several research institutes. In this trial the skin microcirculation will be measured on the ventral aspect of the forearm using a Perimed Laser Doppler imager and iontophoresis system.\n\nEndothelial-mediated vasodilation will be measured by the iontophoresis of acetylcholine, while sodium nitroprusside will be used to measure endothelium-independent vasodilation. The iontophoresis system consists of an ION chamber (iontophoresis delivery vehicle device) that sticks firmly to the skin and a reference electrode. The response in blood flow will be imaged and quantified using the Perimed Laser Doppler Imager (Sweden).\n\nAssessment of calcaneal BMD at baseline and at 6 months This is a simple and convenient method to assess peripheral BMD and assess fracture risk. The device used is a quantitative ultrasound called Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer (Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer; Hologic, Waltham, MA). The calcaneus is the preferred peripheral site to assess fracture risk. This device uses ultrasound waves to determine the BMD of the calcaneus. In this procedure, once the bare heel is placed in the device, the BMD is calculated within 30 seconds and the results are then generated on paper by the device.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS The results obtained from this study will be reported as a difference between the baseline and 6 months later following a single daily oral dose of 20 mg isosorbide mononitrate. The difference between the 2 groups will also be inferred at the end of 6 months. The changes in skeletal parameters (serum P1NP and CTX) and microcirculation will be compared between the 2 groups using t-tests to determine post hoc differences. A p-value of \\< 0.05 will be considered significant. All analyses will be conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).\n\nDURATION OF THE STUDY The estimated time for enrolment of patients will be within 6 months. The duration of the study is 6 months and the last follow up will be at the end of 12 months."

                    "briefSummary": "The goal of this experimental randomized controlled study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the exercise program to be applied to prevent foot wounds, which is one of the leading foot problems that develop as a result of diabetes, based on foot posture and plantar pressure distribution.\n\nParticipants who meet the inclusion criteria and are between the ages of 18-65 will be randomly assigned to one of the two experimental groups or the control group.Participants will be assessed through surveys to evaluate their physical activity level, foot health and functionality, and sensory status of the feet. Measurements related to foot position and posture will be taken. The use of a pedobarography device will allow for the examination of plantar pressure distribution. Following these assessments, participants will receive general foot care instructions and information on appropriate footwear, along with the designated exercise program.\n\nDuring routine check-ups and treatment procedures related to diabetes, blood glucose levels and HbA1c values taken from participants will be analyzed by the physician before and after the program to make comparisons. The study is planned to last for 12 weeks, and evaluations will be conducted before and after the program.",
                    "detailedDescription": "According to the literature, evaluations for preventing and treating diabetic foot ulcers commonly include plantar pressure measurements, and it is emphasized that methods involving plantar pressure technologies should be added to traditional evaluations to be more successful in preventing diabetic foot ulcers, even in high-risk individuals.\n\nBased on the findings from previous research, it is believed that the reduced foot intrinsic muscle strength, which has not been extensively examined in its relationship with other factors, needs to be systematically investigated for its effects on foot related measurements and plantar pressure. Furthermore, there seems to be insufficient information regarding exercise interventions focusing on foot intrinsic muscle training for preventing ulcer development in diabetic foot. Therefore, the aim of the study is to examine the effects of foot intrinsic muscle training on foot posture and plantar pressure distribution in individuals with diabetic foot syndrome. By elucidating these factors, it is hoped that the exercise protocol focusing on foot intrinsic muscle training, implemented to prevent ulcer formation, will contribute to the literature and reduce the burdens associated with the disease.\n\nHypotheses of the study:\n\nH0: Foot intrinsic muscle training has no effect on plantar pressure in individuals with diabetic foot syndrome.\n\nH1: Foot intrinsic muscle training has an effect on plantar pressure in individuals with diabetic foot syndrome.\n\nH2: Foot intrinsic muscle training has no effect on foot posture in individuals with diabetic foot syndrome.\n\nH3: Foot intrinsic muscle training has an effect on foot posture in individuals with diabetic foot syndrome.\n\nIn this study, individuals with diabetic foot syndrome between the ages of 18-65 will be included. The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial, and the participants will be divided into three groups: one control group (Group 1) and two experimental groups (Group 2 and Group 3). The sample size was determined using the G-power program. According to the results obtained, it was calculated that a total of 30 individuals should be included in the study, with 10 participants in each group, considering a statistical power level of 82% and a significance level of 5%.\n\nAs part of the research, investigators will gain insights into participants' foot health through questionnaire questions, complete observational analyses of foot and foot-related measurements, evaluate participants' plantar pressure distribution using pedobarographic analysis, and implement exercise protocols focusing on foot intrinsic muscle training.\n\nThe study was designed with evaluation and treatment protocols. Demographic information and physical activity levels of the participants to be included in the study will be recorded. The measurements related to the foot will include evaluation of foot posture, goniometric measurements, assessment of tactile sensation, plantar pressure distribution analysis, and questionnaire evaluations. In addition to all these assessments, participants' blood values will be examined by the doctor before and after treatment.\n\nThe treatment protocols consist of general foot care instructions and information about appropriate footwear selection, along with exercise protocols. Group 1 - Control Group participants will receive only general foot care instructions and education on appropriate footwear selection. Group 2 participants will receive general foot care instructions and education on appropriate footwear selection, along with an exercise protocol focusing on foot intrinsic muscle training. Group 3 participants will receive general foot care instructions and education on appropriate footwear selection, foot intrinsic muscle training, and in addition, an aerobic exercise protocol. The treatment protocols will be implemented for 12 weeks, and pre- and post-treatment evaluations will be repeated to compare the results."

All subjects currently treated with exogenous testosterone will discontinue at screening for at least 21 days and remain off testosterone for the course of the study. One hundred twenty to 150 subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups according to a 1:1:1 ratio. Subjects will receive one of two dose strengths of Androxal or placebo in addition to their usual dose of mono- or combination OHAs for three months. Following an initial screening period, subjects will return monthly for 3 months and 1 month later for a follow-up visit."

No history of blood diseases including but not limited to clinically significant platelet diseases and coagulation abnormalities.\n6. No clinically relevant gastrointestinal disease.\n7. Have an estimated creatinine (CREA) clearance\\>70 mL/min/surface area (CREA clearance will be calculated from the serum CREA value by using the Cockroft and Gault formula).\n8. Have no history of heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension or other known clinically significant cardiovascular disease.\n9. Have no history of bronchial asthma or 'Aspirin Triad' (chronic rhino-sinusitis with polyps, severe asthma and intolerance to aspirin or other NSAIDs).\n10. Have no clinically significant abnormality of liver tests before entry into the study.\n11. A negative urinary drugs of abuse screen, determined within 28 days before the first dose (N.B. a positive alcohol result may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator).\n12. Negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (Hep B) and hepatitis C virus antibody (Hep C) results.\n13. No clinically significant abnormalities in a 12-lead ECG determined within 28 days before the first dose.\n14. No history of clinically significant renal disease or any food intolerance.\n15. Willing to use 2 effective methods of contraception i.e. established method of contraception + condom, if applicable (unless anatomically sterile or where abstaining from sexual intercourse is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) from Day 1 until 3 months afterwards.\n\nAdditional Criteria for Part 1 (Healthy Subjects):\n\n1. Healthy males aged 18 to 55 inclusive.\n2. Body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18-30 kg/m2 inclusive.\n3. Non-Smokers (including e-cigarettes) who have abstained from smoking for at least 6 months.\n\nAdditional Criteria for Part 2 (Type 2 Diabetic Patients):\n\n1. Males aged 18 to 65 inclusive. BMI within the range of 18-38 kg/m2 inclusive.\n2. Diagnosis of T2DM according to the World Health Organization criteria.\n3. HbA1c between 7.0% and 12.0 % inclusive.\n4. Currently treated with metformin with a stable treatment regimen for 3 months or more prior to the Screening Visit, and not receiving other anti-diabetic medications. Allowed medication during the study include metformin, statin (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors), paracetamol up to 3 g/day, low doses of aspirin and antihypertensive drugs if the doses are not changed in the 3 months before the start of screening. Other allowed medications will be approved by PI and Sponsor before a patient can be enrolled. Diflunisal (a test drug component) may decrease the antihypertensive activityof many of the currently used antihypertensive medications, such as \u03b2-blockers, alpha (\u03b1)-blockers, loop diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors), angiotensin 2 receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers. Therefore, patients who are on current stable antihypertensive medications will be subjected to close monitoring of their blood pressure throughout the study.\n5. Stable dietary habits and regimen of treatment for concomitant diseases for 1 month or more prior to the Screening Visit.\n6. Subject able and willing to undergo oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nPart 1 (Healthy Subjects) and Part 2 (Type 2 Diabetic Patients):\n\n1.

1. What are the key ethical challenges in public health research compared to biomedical research?
   - Community and Population Focus: Unlike biomedical research, which focuses on individual patients, public health research often deals with entire communities and populations. This raises ethical concerns about collective risks and benefits.
   - Consent Complexity: Ethical challenges arise in gaining informed consent, as public health research often involves interventions at a community level rather than individual decision-making.
   - Broader Socioeconomic Context: Public health research must consider social, political, and economic factors, which may introduce additional ethical dilemmas.
   - Ethical Oversight: Traditional biomedical research ethics frameworks may not fully capture the unique challenges of public health interventions.

2. Why is distinguishing between public health research and public health practice important?
   - Research: Focuses on generating generalizable knowledge that benefits people beyond the immediate participants. It often requires ethical approval and strict regulations.
   - Practice: Aims to prevent or control disease and improve health programs. It focuses on directly benefiting participants rather than producing broader scientific knowledge.
   - Blurred Boundaries: Some activities, like public health surveillance, can involve both research and practice, making ethical oversight challenging.
   - Regulatory Implications: In some jurisdictions (e.g., the United States), legal requirements dictate whether an activity is classified as research or practice, impacting ethical review processes.

3. What are the limitations of current ethical guidelines for public health research?
   - Individual-Centric Focus: These guidelines were designed mainly for clinical/biomedical research, emphasizing individual autonomy rather than community-wide interventions.
   - Rigid Regulatory Approach: Overreliance on strict compliance can discourage ethical reflection, leading to a checklist-based approach rather than true moral judgment.
   - Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) Bias: Many guidelines assume RCTs as the gold standard, ignoring that public health research often uses alternative methods (e.g., cluster trials) that present different ethical concerns.
   - Underrepresentation of Community Perspectives: Existing regulations often fail to capture community-based ethical values, leading to ethical blind spots in population-level studies.

4. How can ethical oversight in public health research be improved?
   - Risk-Based Review: Instead of rigidly categorizing research vs. practice, ethical oversight should focus on the level of risk posed to participants.
   - Community Engagement: Ethical frameworks should actively involve communities in decision-making, ensuring that research benefits both individuals and populations.
   - Training for Review Committees: Ethics review board members should receive formal training in public health ethics, not just biomedical research ethics.
   - Adaptability of Guidelines: Ethical guidelines should be flexible, allowing for context-specific ethical judgments rather than enforcing strict rules that may not fit public health research scenarios.
